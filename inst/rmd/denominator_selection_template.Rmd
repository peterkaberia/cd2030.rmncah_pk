## 2. Health Facility Data Adjustments {-}

### Background

Completeness of reporting affects analysis, especially if it is low or varies between 
years. Extreme outliers can have a large impact, especially on subnational numbers.
Several steps are necessary to obtain a clean data set for “endline” analysis, 
including adjusting for incomplete reporting and correcting for extreme outliers. 
These graphs show the impact on the numbers.

```{r}
adjustments <- data %>%
  generate_adjustment_values(adjustment = 'custom', k_factors = !!k_factors)
```

### Health facility data adjustment: Numerators - reported live births

```{r}
plot(adjustments,
     indicator = 'instlivebirths',
     title = 'Figure 1c: Comparison of number of live births before and after adjustments for completness and outliers') +
  cd_report_theme()
```

### Health facility data adjustment: Numerators - reported Penta 1 doses

```{r}
plot(adjustments,
     indicator = 'penta1',
     title = 'Figure 1d: Comparison of number of penta1 vaccination before and after adjustments for completness and outliers') +
  cd_report_theme()
```

#### 📝 Notes 

::: {custom-style="Style1"}

Consider the effect of the adjustment on live births in health facilities, and mention the difference in the number, as well as the percent increase in 2023; highlight the year with the greatest impact if there is one; interpret if the impact of the adjustment on coverage rates is is large or small

Make the same description and interpretations for penta1 vaccinations

## 3. Health facility data denominator assessment: DHIS2, UN Population and livebirths projections {-}

### Background

Service coverage is defined as the population who received the service divided by 
the population who need the services: the denominator. The quality of the population 
projections in DHIS2 is assessed through consistency over time and comparison with 
the UN projections.


### Total Population Projections: DHIS2 and UN Populations

```{r}
plot(prepare_population_metrics(adjusted_data, un_estimates = un_estimates), metric = 'population') +
  cd_report_theme()
```

### Live Births Projections: DHIS2 and UN Live births

```{r}
plot(prepare_population_metrics(adjusted_data, un_estimates = un_estimates), metric = 'births') +
  cd_report_theme()
```

#### 📝 Notes 

::: {custom-style="Style1"}

---

The interpretation should focus on the extent to which the DHIS2 projections are considered robust which is the case when: 1) the DHIS2 total population projection is consistent over time with regular population growth 2) the DHIS2 total live birth projection consistent over time (regular trend) 3) the projected numbers of total population and live births are close to the UN population projection 4) the DHIS2 population projections are consistent with UN estimates for crude birth rate and crude death rate. 

Make your overall conclusion about the quality of the DHIS2 projection, especially live births

## 4. Selection of the best denominator {-}

### Background

The best performing denominator for coverage analysis with facility data is selected by comparing how close the different denominator methods are to survey coverage for a nearby year. This is done at the national and subnational levels (using the median difference with the survey).

### Denominators selection based on Penta3 Coverage

```{r}
indicator_coverage <- cache$calculate_indicator_coverage('national')

indicator_coverage %>% 
  filter_indicator_coverage('penta3', unname(survey_estimates['penta3'])) %>% 
  plot() +
  cd_report_theme()

```


### Denominator selection based on Institutional Delivery

```{r}
indicator_coverage %>% 
  filter_indicator_coverage('instdeliveries', unname(survey_estimates['ideliv'])) %>% 
  plot() +
  cd_report_theme()
```

#### 📝 Notes 

::: {custom-style="Style1"}

Which denominator methods performed best at the national level for the two indicators?

Which indicator performed best at the subnational level for the two indicators?

What selection is made for the indicators in the coverage analyses?
