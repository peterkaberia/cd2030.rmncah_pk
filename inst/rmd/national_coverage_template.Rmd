## 5. National Estimates: National Vaccination Coverage trends {-}

### Background

Monitoring the coverage of interventions is a critical and direct output of health 
systems. It is most useful if the national plan has meaningful targets. Both health 
facility and survey data need to be used.

### ANC Indicators

**Coverage Trends for ANC4**

```{r}
national_coverage <- cache$calculate_coverage('national')

national_coverage %>% 
  filter_coverage('anc4', denominator = cache$get_denominator('anc4')) %>% 
  plot() +
  cd_report_theme()
```

**Coverage Trends for ANC First Trimeter**
```{r}
national_coverage %>% 
  filter_coverage('anc_1trimester', denominator = cache$get_denominator('anc_1trimester')) %>% 
  plot() +
  cd_report_theme()
```

#### 📝 Notes

First address data quality: Are the levels and trends plausible? Is there good consistency between the facility and survey data? 

Then, interpret the data if there is sufficient confidence in the observed levels and trends. How does the coverage perform compared to the targets? Is this a positive trend? Are there explanations for the observed levels and trends?

### Delivery Care

**Coverage Trends for live births**

```{r}
national_coverage %>% 
  filter_coverage('instlivebirths', denominator = cache$get_denominator('instlivebirths')) %>% 
  plot() +
  cd_report_theme()
```

**Coverage Trends for Instituational Deliveries**

```{r}
national_coverage %>% 
  filter_coverage('instdeliveries', denominator = cache$get_denominator('instdeliveries')) %>% 
  plot() +
  cd_report_theme()
```

```{r}
national_coverage %>% 
  filter_coverage('pnc48h', denominator = cache$get_denominator('pnc48h')) %>%

## subnational coverage: assessment of percent of regions that have reached international targets

### Background

Monitoring the coverage of interventions is a critical and direct output of health systems. It is most useful if the national plan has meaningful targets. Both health facility and survey data need to be used.

#### Maternal

```{r}
indicator_coverage <- cache$calculate_indicator_coverage('adminlevel_1')

indicator_coverage %>%
  calculate_threshold(indicator = 'maternal', denominator = cache$maternal_denominator) %>% 
  plot()
```

#### Vaccines

```{r}
indicator_coverage <- cache$calculate_indicator_coverage('adminlevel_1')

indicator_coverage %>%
  calculate_threshold(indicator = 'vaccine', denominator = cache$denominator) %>% 
  plot()
```

First address data quality: Are the levels and trends plausible? Is there good consistency between the facility and survey data? 

Then, interpret the data if there is sufficient confidence in the observed levels and trends. The interpretation should focus on whether inequalities have reduced over time and to what extent global targets for subnational coverage have been met.
