# KEY FINDINGS

## 1. Health facility data quality assessment: numerators and denominators

**NUMERATORS:** Routinely reported health facility data are an important data source for health indicators. The data are reported by health facilities on events such as immunizations given, or live births attended. As with any data, quality is an issue. Data are assessed for completeness of reporting by health facilities, extreme outliers and internal consistency. Appropriate adjustments are made to the data before use to compute statistics.

**Interpretations**

- What is the overall quality of the data as assessed by the overall annual data quality score?
- Is there a data quality pattern by year for which there is an explanation? 
- Are there certain regions or other subnational units that are particularly problematic?
- Are there certain reporting forms or services (e.g., antenatal care, labour and delivery, immunization) that are problematic? Was an adjustment done for incomplete reporting (provide the k value)?
- Is there good consistency between reported numbers of ANC1 and penta1? If not, what could be the explanation?

**DENOMINATORS:** Service coverage is defined as the population who received the service (numerator) divided by the population who need the services: (the denominator). We test four options for denominator measures using institutional live births and Pent-3 immunization coverage (Figures 2c and 2d). The quality of the population projections in DHIS2 is assessed through consistency over time and comparison with the UN projections. Two denominators are also derived using near universal service such as ANC-1 and Penta-1. The most plausible is identified for use to generate other statistics.

```{r, fig.width=6.3}

**Interpretations**

- A plausible ratio is in the range of 5 to 25 stillbirths per maternal death. Is the national ratio within the expected range?
- What can be said about the top 3 and bottom 3 regions?
- If the ratio is above 25, this may mean that maternal deaths are more underreported than stillbirths. If it is below 5, stillbirths are likely underreported. If the ratio is within the range, the reporting may be good if the mortality levels are in the expected range. If not, then both maternal deaths and stillbirths are underreported.
